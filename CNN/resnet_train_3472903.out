INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of opencv-python-headless to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested numpy<2
    opencv-python-headless 4.12.0.88 depends on numpy<2.3.0 and >=2; python_version >= "3.9"

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    numpy

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
